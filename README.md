# Spatial Raman Analysis

A Python tool for analyzing and visualizing spatial Raman spectroscopy data.


## Example Output

![Example output showing spatial distribution of Raman intensity](figures/example.png)

The figure above shows an example spatial distribution map generated by the tool, where color intensity represents Raman signal strength at each measured point in the grid.


## Overview

This tool processes Raman spectroscopy data collected across a spatial grid to generate:

- Spectral visualizations
- Peak analysis
- Spatial distribution maps
- Statistical correlation analysis


## Usage

Run the analysis with:
